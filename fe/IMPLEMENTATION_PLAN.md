# EQDB Frontend Implementation Plan

## API-Driven Development Strategy

### Swagger/OpenAPI Integration
- **Single Source of Truth**: All frontend types and API calls should be generated from or validated against the Swagger specification at `http://localhost:5001/swagger.json`
- **Type Safety**: Ensure all API interfaces match the exact schema defined in the Swagger docs
- **Automatic Updates**: When API changes, frontend types should be updated accordingly
- **Validation**: Use runtime validation to ensure API responses match expected schemas

### API-First Development Principles
1. **Schema-Driven**: All data models should be derived from the API specification
2. **Contract-First**: API contracts (Swagger) define the interface between frontend and backend
3. **Versioning**: Handle API versioning gracefully with proper type definitions
4. **Documentation**: Keep frontend documentation in sync with API documentation

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Service Layer**: Each API endpoint should have a corresponding service function
- **Type Generation**: Consider using tools like `openapi-typescript` to generate types from Swagger
- **Error Handling**: Handle all possible API error responses as defined in Swagger
- **Testing**: Test against actual API responses to ensure type compatibility
