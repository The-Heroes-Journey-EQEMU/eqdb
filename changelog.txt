Deployed: 2/11/2025
* Continued to expand tooltips:
  ** Elemental damage is now shown on tooltips
  ** Aug slots are now shown on tooltips

* Fixed searching for items by name after previously doing so.
* Click and Proc effect names are now shown on the output page when requested as filters (including Clicks).
  ** IMPORTANT: When searching for procs and clicks other than Sympathetics, the current code is taking awhile to load
                the relevant data.  This will be fixed in the next update which is going to see a large refactoring
                of the behind the scenes code.
* Searching for base and enchanted items has been removed, as they were hardly used.
* Re-ordered the radio buttons for Base/Legendary items to put them on the same line.
* Added the ammo slot so that arrows can actually be searched for.
** All arrows are presently made with tradeskills, so this will not actually do anything yet.
