==1.7.2==
Deployed: 3/26/2025
CHANGES:
* Added personal item identification statistics when you complete a submission.
* Added an item identification leaderboard for both contributions and identifications.
* Fixed a bug with tooltips referencing the wrong spell table.

==1.7.1==
Deployed: 3/21/2025
CHANGES:
* Fixed a one time error on the first time a user submits an item identification
* Added logic to make it so that item identifications prefer ones that have partial identifications already.

==1.7==
Deployed: 3/21/2025
CHANGES:
* Added 'Item Identify' "minigame"
  ** To start, select 'Item Identify' from either the landing page or the navigation bar.
  ** An item that has not yet been associated with an expansion, source, and/or zone will be shown.
  ** Use the selectors to identify where this item comes from.
  ** Once an item has reached a specific 'confidence' threshold, it will be moved from unidentified to identified
  ** Every contributor who helped get an item to identified will be credited with doing so, which will increase their
     subsequent identifications.
  ** This data is used by both EQDB and THJ to allow items to be as accurate as possible.
  ** Items that are not gear will show up, this still helps both EQDB and THJ.
     *** THJ can use this to make sure drops are 100% accurate for whatever expansion is opened.
     *** EQDB can ignore or include items that otherwise might be filtered in / filtered out by algorithms.
  ** This will use Discord's login system to attribute identification data.
  ** You do not have to use Discord login, however an anonymous identification will be substantially reduced on the
     amount of confidence it will provide and there will be no credit applied to anonymous.
  ** There is a potential for rewards for the most contributors over a period of time.
  ** The goal of this is that users will occasionally identify a couple of items in between doing other stuff.
  ** This feature is in a BETA TEST, your identifications may be reset if bugs are found.

==1.6.1==
Deployed: 3/20/225
CHANGES:
* Updated weighting and stat restrictions to allow for decimal or 'float' numbers (eg: 1.5, 2.66, 9.9999998)

==1.6==
Deployed: 3/8/2025
CHANGES:
* Added "Delay", "Weapon Efficency", and "Proc Rate" to required stats dropdown.
  ** Delay is inverted.  For example, providing a stat weight of 20 will give items with delay at 20 or less.
* Added "Delay" and "Proc Rate" to stat weights.
  ** Reminder that weights can be negative!
* Reworked "Include Temporary Items" into "Toggle Pet Search"
  ** This will do the following:
    *** Disable the requirement that slot, class, or focus must be searched for.
    *** Includes temporary items in the search.
* Fixed output table to show click, worn, focus, and instrument mod simultaneously instead of just one.
  ** Instrument and Worn will only show the effect name, since you kind of know what you're getting with those.
* Linked spell names on search result page to thjdi.cc
* Added proc rate to tooltips.
* Added "Planned Enhancements" to changelog.

PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS:
(NOTE: There is no order or timeframe on any of these.  They're simply 'in the works' and will be made available
when they're ready!)
* Allow users to report an item that appears to be in the incorrect expansion.
  ** This will use Discord oauth to record reports.  Why?  See the next note.
* Add """minigame""" called 'Identify Items' that will allow users to support both THJ and EQDB by supplying expansion,
  zone, and source data on items that aren't already identified.
  ** This will use a "confidence" system that will be based on what users provide to attribute an item to it's correct
     source, zone, or era.  As items are acccepted, an individual user's contributor score will increase, which will
     give more weight to their subsequent corrections.
  ** It is possible that this could result in rewards on the THJ server itself, but said rewards are under discussion!
* Add spell tooltips to the output page when searching for focuses, procs, worn items, or bard instrument mods.
  ** These are somewhat more complicated to handle than item tooltips.
* Add "Create Target Gear List" functionality
  ** This will allow you to provide item weights as normal, as well as "gearing strategies" that will determine how the
     list is made.
  ** These lists can be made public, with upvote capability to allow the community to see what other users and their
     trio specs might be using as a basis for their own searches.

==1.5.1==
Deployed: 3/3/2025
* Temporarily removed requirement that something must be provided.
  ** This was preventing pet gear searches.  This will be re-introduced when "include temporary items" is reworked into
     "pet search" which will do more things.

==1.5==
Deployed: 2/28/2025
* Most tradeskill items added.
  ** There is a chance out of era stuff will show up in gear searches.  Be aware of this if exceptionally powerful items
  ** show up, and please let me know via Discord if you find any.  Additionally, there may not be items showing up,
  ** if they're particularly useful, again, let me know!
* Removed out of era quest items.
  ** These are almost invariably Epic 1.5 and 2.0 weapons, as the quests tended to reuse a lot of the original quest
  ** givers, such as the sarnak imitator in Burning Woods for both Enchanter Epic 1.0 and 1.5.  Let me know if you find
  ** any items missing or quest items that are still clearly out of era for the search you are conducting.
* Added bard instrument modifier search.
  ** Bard items, usually visible armor and starting in Planes of Power, will have instrument modifiers.  This search
  ** will let you find the best items that have the instrument modifier in question.
* Added instrument focuses to tooltips.

==1.4.1==
Deployed: 2/21/2025
* Armor search "All Types" will now find augs in addition to regular items.
  ** Aug-only search remains the same by selecting item type 'Augment'

==1.4.0==
Deployed: 2/21/2025
* Added worn effects to tooltips
* Added "Melee Worn Effects" as a 'focus' search filter
  ** These are: Ferocity, Cleaving, Improved Dodge, Improved Block/Parry, and Sharpshooting
* Split weapons out into their own search page.
  ** Options are starting to get a little cluttered and weapons are very much their own thing.  This split moves everything
  ** involved with searching for weapons to its own page.
  ** You can still search for primary/secondary on the main Armor search page and weapons will show up, but only
  ** based on their stats, not damage or efficiency.
* Fixed poison and disease direct damage, DoT damage focus searches, and pet power searches
  ** This includes a re-write to move them from static IDs to using the DB to find the relevant spell IDs.
* Condensed the item search page a bit by making some information hover-over reported.

==1.3.2==
Deployed: 2/18/2025
* Fixed searching for backstab damage
* Added backstab damage to tooltips

==1.3.1==
Deployed: 2/18/2025

==1.3.0==
Deployed: 2/18/2025
* Refactored searching logic.
  ** This should dramatically speed up results.
* Added proc/click level to tooltips
* Added proc and click maximum level filter
  ** Set this to only return procs or clicks that are proc/click level or lower to use.
* Added a link to gear searching to the main for users that can't see the header bar for some reason.
* Fixed Quest and Tradeskill item names.

==1.2.1==
Deployed: 2/12/2025
* Fixed name correction algorithm

Deployed: 2/11/2025
* Continued to expand tooltips:

  ** Aug slots are now shown on tooltips
  ** Bane damage is now shown on tooltips
* Corrected several tooltips to more closely match EverQuest's default item window.
* Added 'Elemental Damage' and 'Bane Damage' as stat requirements and stat weights.
  ** Selectors have been added for the type of elemental damage and bane damage, including all
* Added Serubane weapons.
* Added Corrupted Shissarbane weapons.
* Fixed searching for tradeskill items by name.
* Fixed searching for items by name after previously doing so.
* Click and Proc effect names are now shown on the output page when requested as filters (including Clicks).
  ** IMPORTANT: When searching for procs and clicks other than Sympathetics, the current code is taking awhile to load
                the relevant data.  This will be fixed in the next update which is going to see a large refactoring
                of the behind the scenes code.
* Searching for base and enchanted items has been removed, as they were hardly used.
* Re-ordered the radio buttons for Base/Legendary items to put them on the same line.
* Added the ammo slot so that arrows can actually be searched for.
** All arrows are presently made with tradeskills, so this will not actually do anything yet.

* Stat restrictions are now available
* Added filtering for items with click effects available to your class(es)
* Added filtering for Sympathetic Strike and Sympathetic Healing items
* Changed tooltips to load from eqdb.net instead of thjdi.cc
** Are you a person who has more than 'oh god, I think it looks okay?' capabilities with CSS?  Contact Convection on
   discord, Taliea in game, or sc2convection on reddit if you'd like to help make the tooltips look better!
* Weapon efficiency has been renamed 'Weapon Ratio' because that's what it is.
* Added "Backstab Damage" as a stat or weight filter.
