==1.6==
* Added "Delay", "Weapon Efficency", and "Proc Rate" to required stats dropdown.
  ** Delay is inverted.  For example, providing a stat weight of 20 will give items with delay at 20 or less.
* Added "Delay" and "Proc Rate" to stat weights.
  ** Reminder that weights can be negative!
* TODO: Reworked "Include Temporary Items" into "Toggle Pet Search"
  ** This will do the following:
    *** Disable the requirement that slot, class, or focus must be searched for.
    *** Calculates 2H ratio with a maximum delay of 40.
    *** Includes temporary items in the search.
* Fixed output table to show click, worn, focus, and instrument mod simultaneously instead of just one.
  ** Instrument and Worn will only show the effect name, since you kind of know what you're getting with those.
* Linked spell names on search result page to thjdi.cc
* Added proc rate to tooltips.

==1.5.1==
Deployed: 3/3/2025
* Temporarily removed requirement that something must be provided.
  ** This was preventing pet gear searches.  This will be re-introduced when "include temporary items" is reworked into
     "pet search" which will do more things.

==1.5==
Deployed: 2/28/2025
* Most tradeskill items added.
  ** There is a chance out of era stuff will show up in gear searches.  Be aware of this if exceptionally powerful items
  ** show up, and please let me know via Discord if you find any.  Additionally, there may not be items showing up,
  ** if they're particularly useful, again, let me know!
* Removed out of era quest items.
  ** These are almost invariably Epic 1.5 and 2.0 weapons, as the quests tended to reuse a lot of the original quest
  ** givers, such as the sarnak imitator in Burning Woods for both Enchanter Epic 1.0 and 1.5.  Let me know if you find
  ** any items missing or quest items that are still clearly out of era for the search you are conducting.
* Added bard instrument modifier search.
  ** Bard items, usually visible armor and starting in Planes of Power, will have instrument modifiers.  This search
  ** will let you find the best items that have the instrument modifier in question.
* Added instrument focuses to tooltips.

==1.4.1==
Deployed: 2/21/2025
* Armor search "All Types" will now find augs in addition to regular items.
  ** Aug-only search remains the same by selecting item type 'Augment'

==1.4.0==
Deployed: 2/21/2025
* Added worn effects to tooltips
* Added "Melee Worn Effects" as a 'focus' search filter
  ** These are: Ferocity, Cleaving, Improved Dodge, Improved Block/Parry, and Sharpshooting
* Split weapons out into their own search page.
  ** Options are starting to get a little cluttered and weapons are very much their own thing.  This split moves everything
  ** involved with searching for weapons to its own page.
  ** You can still search for primary/secondary on the main Armor search page and weapons will show up, but only
  ** based on their stats, not damage or efficiency.
* Fixed poison and disease direct damage, DoT damage focus searches, and pet power searches
  ** This includes a re-write to move them from static IDs to using the DB to find the relevant spell IDs.
* Condensed the item search page a bit by making some information hover-over reported.

==1.3.2==
Deployed: 2/18/2025
* Fixed searching for backstab damage
* Added backstab damage to tooltips

==1.3.1==
Deployed: 2/18/2025
* Fixed error when search doesn't return anything.
* Added Intricate Wooden Figurines to Planes of Power quest items.

==1.3.0==
Deployed: 2/18/2025
* Refactored searching logic.
  ** This should dramatically speed up results.
* Added proc/click level to tooltips
* Added proc and click maximum level filter
  ** Set this to only return procs or clicks that are proc/click level or lower to use.
* Added a link to gear searching to the main for users that can't see the header bar for some reason.
* Fixed Quest and Tradeskill item names.

==1.2.1==
Deployed: 2/12/2025
* Fixed name correction algorithm

==1.2.0==
Deployed: 2/11/2025
* Continued to expand tooltips:
  ** Elemental damage is now shown on tooltips
  ** Aug slots are now shown on tooltips
  ** Bane damage is now shown on tooltips
* Corrected several tooltips to more closely match EverQuest's default item window.
* Added 'Elemental Damage' and 'Bane Damage' as stat requirements and stat weights.
  ** Selectors have been added for the type of elemental damage and bane damage, including all
* Added Serubane weapons.
* Added Corrupted Shissarbane weapons.
* Fixed searching for tradeskill items by name.
* Fixed searching for items by name after previously doing so.
* Click and Proc effect names are now shown on the output page when requested as filters (including Clicks).
  ** IMPORTANT: When searching for procs and clicks other than Sympathetics, the current code is taking awhile to load
                the relevant data.  This will be fixed in the next update which is going to see a large refactoring
                of the behind the scenes code.
* Searching for base and enchanted items has been removed, as they were hardly used.
* Re-ordered the radio buttons for Base/Legendary items to put them on the same line.
* Added the ammo slot so that arrows can actually be searched for.
** All arrows are presently made with tradeskills, so this will not actually do anything yet.

* Stat restrictions are now available
* Added filtering for items with click effects available to your class(es)
* Added filtering for Sympathetic Strike and Sympathetic Healing items
* Changed tooltips to load from eqdb.net instead of thjdi.cc
** Are you a person who has more than 'oh god, I think it looks okay?' capabilities with CSS?  Contact Convection on
   discord, Taliea in game, or sc2convection on reddit if you'd like to help make the tooltips look better!
* Weapon efficiency has been renamed 'Weapon Ratio' because that's what it is.
* Added "Backstab Damage" as a stat or weight filter.
